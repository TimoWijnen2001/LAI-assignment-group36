       "'Good on you for being responsible! I know self-discipline is difficult, but it\\'s good that you\\'ve got your priorities in order. Good luck on your finals. I\\'m sorry that happened. I think the people who said that genuinely believed it was the best option for you so I can\\'t be too mad at them. I posted below and I\\'ll say it again: that 0 tolerance response is likely due to trauma and stress involving some sort of mistreatment those people endured in the past. They\\'re not saying it to be malicious, they\\'re just saying it because that\\'s the measure they would feel is necessary to protect themselves if they were in that situation. It\\'s their own way of looking out for you, just how I suggested talking it out. I\\'m happy the two of you did talk and that he made it up to you, and I hope your relationship continues to be happy and healthy. Sending love and light 🕯️💗 They\\'re both single so I don\\'t understand why they have to hide their relationship. I never have understood it. Also, the fact that Lewis wants to keep it secret but Marnie doesn\\'t makes me suspect some shady things on Lewis\\'s end. Marnie would be happier with someone who put her first, and I think the only reason she\\'s still with Lewis is because she has trouble putting herself first. That\\'s why I think a self-esteem related character arc could be beautiful for her. Reminds me of that Junji Ito story with the furniture maker who lived inside of an armchair to be with the woman he loved. Basically, yes, but only if you trust your teenager to take care of their things. It is very expensive, but it\\'s also insanely fun and convenient. It\\'s a gaming PC in the form of a handheld device, and it should be treated as such. With the price tag, it\\'s also not something that can be easily replaced if the teen handles the device irresponsibily. I will also say that Steam\\'s/Valve\\'s (they\\'re the same company) Steam Decks come with a warranty so they cover most repairs. I think the biggest factor that impacted my decision to buy one was: Would I rather buy this device that lets me play all the games I already own in a handheld format OR would I rather replace all of those games on a handheld device I already own? I have a big library of games on Steam already, so it was cheaper for me to purchase a Steam Deck than it was to replace all of those games on my Nintendo Switch or smartphone. I would assume it is a similar case with your teenager if they play video games frequently. I would also like to add that I know how incredibly difficult it is to get a teenager out of their room. This Steam Deck would provide a good opportunity to invite your teen to bring their games with them to the living room to hang out. So they\\'re basically molesting him? Touching hit butt and kissing him is highly inappropriate and also illegal. It doesn\\'t matter that they\\'re 13, this behavior is unacceptable on ALL levels and it will be extremely psychologically damaging to your son. None of the other adults in his life are stepping up for him in a situation where he can\\'t/doesn\\'t know how to stand up for himself. You need to be that adult that stands up for him and says \"this is not okay, and it needs to stop.\" Because clearly dad and step-mom aren\\'t. Those girls\\' behavior is extremely predatory and creepy. You need to talk with dad and step-mom about it before you let your son go back over there. Early childhood professional, not a parent. There are laws against bullying in most states if you live in the US. First, if I were you I would talk to your daughter about it. Talk about her feelings, what she wants to do about it, let he know it\\'s not her fault and some people are just mean. After that, talk to the teacher about the bullying and try to come up with an action plan. Some actions I would take as an educator are: changing the seating arrangement so your daughter doesn\\'t have to be near the bullies, making sure when we line up for lunch that the children remain separated, writing up the students for bullying when caught, and referring your daughter to the school guidance counselor for extra emotional support. Do NOT end that talk with the teacher without either getting some form of written or digital acknowledgement that the issue was brought to their attention. If your daughter continues being bullied and the teacher is not intervening/implementing the solutions that were agreed upon, go straight up to the principal and bring the documentation from your meeting with the teacher. Make sure you get documentation of your meeting with the principal as well. If the school still does nothing, start looking in to your state laws and meet with the principal to discuss those laws in regards to your daughter\\'s experience with bullying with copies of your documentation from the previous meetings. Teachers and school staff, generally speaking, are lovely. You\\'ll get a few bad ones in the bunch, but most of them really enjoy working with children and trying to make a difference. The US government ruined the public education system, not the teachers and staff. They\\'re extremely overworked and burdened by oppressive regulations. That\\'s still no reason for any child to have to endure bullying. Unfortunately, playing \"school politics\" is the only way to get things done sometimes. I do recommend exhausting the previously mentioned options first though. Try to work with your daughter\\'s teacher if you can. A teacher is a valuable ally when it comes to your child\\'s education. Thank you for sharing and providing an example of the aforementioned \"oppressive regulations\". It isn\\'t the teacher\\'s decision when children use the restroom or not, oftentimes it\\'s a school-wide policy being implemented by your local government and/or administrative school staff forcing teachers to set bathroom policies. There are even some teachers who try to get these restrictions removed but are ultimately overruled. The reasoning behind these rules is that the school/government is worried about vandalism, smoking/vaping in the bathrooms, and fights breaking out. The US government is literally turning schools in to prisons and expecting teachers to act as the wardens. Source: url The highschool I graduated from used to have a 10 minute break between first and second period. They took that break away a couple of years ago because teenagers kept getting in to fights with each other during that break. They also started enforcing stricter bathroom policies. This is NOT the right solution to the problem at all. You\\'re going to have so much fun. Remember to take things at your own pace! And please come back here if you\\'ve got any questions. I hope you enjoy the game. I understand what you\\'re referring to in terms of the behavior of these children, but I have no basis of comparison for your opinion on what \"spoils\" a child. I\\'ve studied early childhood development, and I believe that the difference between a child who constantly relies on/manipulates others, a child who is extremely anxious all the time, and a child who is able to stand on their feet and manage their emotions is two factors: 1) how the child is taught about choice and 2) how failure is handled in the household. I feel that a \"spoiled\" child comes about when they have all their choices made for them or are not given any chances to make choices. This encourages them to be overly dependent on others. Similarly, a child who makes a mistake and has that mistake immediately handled by their parents or other family members will learn that they have no personal consequences and someone else will clean up after them. A child who is a \"high stress people pleaser\" could come about from being given too much independence or too much choice. For example, a very young child who is responsible for dressing themselves every day with absolutely zero help or instruction from parents or family members may feel confused and struggle with the task. This is where failure comes in. If the parents/family members respond to this child not dressing themselves properly with anger, frustration, or extreme disappointment, this is very damaging to the child. It negatively affects their self image and their ability to do things. They will become people pleasers to avoid having others angry at them, and they will have constant stress and anxiety because their failures have been met with harshly negative consequences. There is a balance between the two. When it comes to choice, there are ways to encourage healthy choices without the child being able to ask for extremely unreasonable things, as children do. Two examples are that when someone'"
